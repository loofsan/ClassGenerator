Archived Codes Usage Notes

1. Javascript Folder

   a.  JSWebScraper.js

       - Purpose: The first javascript file in the folder, JSWebScraper.js
                  scraped the Rate my Professor website and returned the results
                  in the form of JSON.

       - Usage: I used this code to scrape the data off of Rate My Professor by
                inputting it in the console of the browser in the page that
                showed a list of all the professors to get the result.

   b.  JsonConverter.js

       - Purpose: The JsonConverter.js file converted the strings of the
                  result into their respective data types. For example, the ratings
                  returned.

       - Usage: To make it easier for my life, I decided to parse out the
                ratings, number of ratings and difficulty to their respective
                data types, which were ints, and floats. I converted to floats
                and not doubles because we didn't have very large decimals.

2. Java Folder

   a.  WebScraper_Selenium.java

       - Purpose: This java file used the library selenium to scrape
                  the data off of web Schedule. This works by inputting the
                  name of the class, MATH 250 (ex.), and the file will use
                  Selenium, which will open a browser to open web schedule
                  site and receive all the data of the classes of that page.

       - Usage: I used this to scrape the classes in the beginning of the
                project. However, I thought of it and I realized that it would
                be a lot more taxing on my computer and unnecessary to keep
                opening a browser and dynamically search every class.

                Not only that, Selenium was outdated by Nov. 26 to use on Chrome
                119v. so I had to change it up.

   b.  WebScraper_Jsoup.java

       - Purpose: This java file used the library Jsoup to scrape data off of
                  Web Schedule.

       - Usage: I used this file and ran it on the main class.

                --- Code ---
                WebScraper_Jsoup scraper = new WebScraper_Jsoup();
                scraper.getData();
                --- Code ---

                I used this to get all the class data from fall classes
                and spring classes alike so that I no longer have to keep
                making a connection everytime and I can just grab the data of
                the classes quickly and efficiently from the resource folder.

                However, one conundrum I faced was that it couldn't scrape all
                the data at once since there are a lot of classes. I could only
                scrape at a maximum of 12 subjects and all the classes under it.
                Thus, I separated into multiple json files and multiple links
                to scrape it.

                This is why in the old-resources folder, you can see multiple
                json files under WebScheduleClassesFall folder and under the
                WebScheduleSpring folder.

   c.  JsonCombiner.java

       - Purpose: This java file was used to combine multiple json files into
                  one json file. This code basically reads the file and writes
                  it onto the new file.

       - Usage: I used this java file to combine the multiple json files I have
                scraped from WebSchedule that I said earlier into one json file
                so that it is more clear and organized. I merged all the fall
                classes file and all the spring classes files as well.

                --- Code ---
                JsonCombiner cb = new JsonCombiner();
                cb.combine();
                --- Code ---

   ------- No longer old-code -------

   d.  JsonToJava.java
       - Purpose: This code converts the Json file of Professors.json in the
                  resources folder into an array so that it's easier to work
                  with and I won't have to read and write a Json file
                  everytime I want to access Professors.

       - Usage: I used this to convert the JSON objects in the Professors.json
                file to Java objects in an array to make it easier to use.

   ------- No longer old-code -------

   e. ClassParser.java

       - Purpose: This code is used to parse the Course Title key in the
                  files of the json classes. Not only that, the second
                  function is to parse out courses that have status,
                  course title and class days empty.

       - Usage:   I used this to change the data that is directly scraped
                  as the site returns, "GEOG 100 - Geography [...]" and
                  I only wanted to use the GEOG 100 part, so I parsed it out of
                  the file.

                  --- Code ---
                  ClassParser parser = new ClassParser();
                  parser.parseJson("src/main/resources/fallCombinedClasses.json");
                  parser.parseJson("src/main/resources/springCombinedClasses.json");
                  --- Code ---

                  Then, I used this to parse out labs and extra work days which
                  doesn't have a status, course title and class days. If I just
                  picked class days, it could've been an online class, so I had
                  to pick out the ones that had all three missing.

                  --- Code ---
                  ClassParser parser = new ClassParser();
                  parser.parseOutKeys("src/main/resources/fallCombinedClasses.json");
                  parser.parseOutKeys("src/main/resources/springCombinedClasses.json");
                  --- Code ---


3. old-resources folder

   a. WebScheduleClassesFall folder

       - Purpose: This folder was used to store all the classes from the
                  district during fall.

       - Usage: I used this folder when I merged all the files in the folder
                to one file.

   b. WebScheduleClassesFall folder

          - Purpose: This folder was used to store all the classes from the
                     district during spring.

          - Usage: I used this folder when I merged all the files in the folder
                   to one file.

   c. Professors.csv

          - Purpose: Store all the professors data in a csv file.

          - Usage: I transformed the json file of professors into a csv file
                   because I wondered if it would be easier to access the data
                   from a csv file. It is, you just parse it, but I wanted to
                   practice using JSON and parsing JSON, so I chose the JSON file
                   and kept with it.

   d. SortedClasses.txt

          - Purpose: Store the best classes under the subject based on the
                     Bayesian Probability

          - Usage: I used this to test the BayesianSorter to see if it's
                   working correctly.

   e. Classes.txt

          -Purpose: Store all the classes of Fall and Spring with
                    compartmentalized in their own subjects

          -Usage: This is used for testing purposes to see if my sorter
                  working correctly.

   f. Combined.txt

          - Purpose: Store all the combined classes of Fall & Spring

          - Usage: This is used for testing purposes as well for my combiner
                   class.

   g. professorNames.txt

          - Purpose: Store all the names of the leftover professors

          - Usage: I used this to find the professors who had 0 number
                   of ratings to make sure they're not on Rate my Professor
